        This is my design of a coffe table book. I created it for my final
        asignment in the Jonkoping University for the Graphic Design course.
        Banksy is a big insipration to me - his art is very specific and often
        includes messages about the UK government. A lot of people see Banksy as
        sort of a symbol - Anarchy.
